        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills,
        values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. 
        Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take 
        place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be 
        considered educational. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed 
        necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, 
        values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily 
        learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. 
        Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, 
        certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices 
        in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), 
        student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.</p>
